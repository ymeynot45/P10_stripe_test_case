You can set a default key, or you can always pass a key directly to an object's constructor. Authentication is transparently handled for you in subsequent method calls.
One of your test API keys has been filled into all the examples on the page, so you can test out any example right away.

  # Display a very generic error to the user, and maybe send
  # yourself an email
